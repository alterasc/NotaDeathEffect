# Not a Death Effect mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous

Unifies logic for non-magical instakill abilities that kill instantly on failed Fortitude save.  

- Removes death descriptor where it was present, so enemies with immunity to death effects can be affected
- Prevents abiltities from working on undead and constructs

List of abilities tweaked:

- Rogue Master Strike
- Ranger Master Hunter
- Slayer Master Slayer
- Slayer (Executioner) Assassinate
- Assassin Death Attack. (On undead and constructs this ability just gives guaranteed crit threat)
- Hunter (Colluding Scoundrel) Master Backstabber
- Monk Quivering Palm (added PnP restriction of not working against targets that are immune to criticals). Scaled Fist version tweaked too.
